•	Goal: Minimize total annual production cost while meeting monthly demand using regular production, overtime, and inventory management.

•	Solution: Developed a linear programming model in Excel to allocate production volumes between regular and overtime capacity (30,000 and 15,000 units/month respectively), incorporating initial inventory and $5/unit monthly holding cost.

•	Result: Achieved an optimal annual production plan with a total cost of $11.25M, balancing cost-effective production and minimal inventory carryover across all periods.
